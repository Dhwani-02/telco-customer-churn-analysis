## Telecom Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction
This project aims to analyze customer churn behavior in the telecom industry using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning. The goal is to uncover insights and build a predictive model to help telecom companies reduce churn and retain customers effectively.

Key Objectives
* Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand churn patterns.
* Clean, preprocess, and transform the data for modeling.
* Build classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest).
* Evaluate model performance using accuracy, F1-score, and R².
* Deploy a sample prediction to demonstrate business use case.

Tools & Technologies
* Python, Pandas, NumPy
* Seaborn, Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn (Pipelines, Preprocessing, Modeling)
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pickle (Model serialization)
* PowerPoint (Project presentation)

Preprocessing Pipeline
* andled missing values with imputation.
* One-hot encoding for categorical variables.
* Standardized numerical features.
* Combined transformations using ColumnTransformer.

Models Used
Model	Accuracy	R² Score
Logistic Regression	~80%	0.21
Random Forest	~83%	0.62
Random Forest provided the best overall performance, capturing complex patterns and yielding more reliable predictions.

Conclusion
This project showcases how data analysis and machine learning can provide actionable insights into customer behavior and enable proactive retention strategies in the telecom industry.
